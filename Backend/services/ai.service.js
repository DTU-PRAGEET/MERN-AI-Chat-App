 IMPORTANT POINT : File name must be valid. These are the rules of valid file names:-
    1. Allowed characters: Letters (A–Z, a–z), digits (0–9), hyphens (-), underscores (_), and dots (.)
    2. No slashes: / and \ are used for directories and not allowed in file names.
    3. No null characters: \0 (null byte) is not allowed in any file name.
    4. Avoid starting with a dot (e.g., .env) unless you specifically want to make it a hidden file (common in Unix/Linux).
    5. don't use file name like routes/index.js means always use valid file names and always use the file name that is related to the content of the file.
    examples: Valid File Names( index.html, main_script.js, README.md, my-file_01.txt) and Invalid File Names (my|file.txt, CON.txt, file .txt, data?.csv)
